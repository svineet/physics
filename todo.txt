Bug:

* Toolbar is ugly
* Implement active state of buttons
* Ground is not visible. There are segments all around. There should only be one ground body, no other static bodies.
* Wierd behaviour with the motor tool.
  Excuse: Pymunk problem. Probably Un-fixable without a really hard to make hack.
* Triangle crazy (kovak halp)
  Excuse: idk whats happenin
* Joint rotation problems (kovak halp pls. pls. pls. ...---...)
  Excuse: idk whats happenin


Critical tools to be implemented:

* Grabber
V.I. ^^

* Android support, cymunk error removal
  Hard one this.
  But opens up gravity with accelerometer feature.

Android support problems:

* Rect not working. Poly not working.
* major inconsistencies with pymunk api causes problems
