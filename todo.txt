Bug:

* Toolbar is ugly
* Toolbar scrolling, too many tools to fit in one place.
* Implement active state of buttons
* Ground is not visible. There are segments all around. There should only be one ground body, no other static bodies.

Enhancement:

* Pen
* Invert Gravity (0, -700) to (0, 700) makes it awesomer!
  Maybe it could be gradual?
* 

Critical tools to be implemented:

* Grabber
* Polygon, would make drawing easier.
* Triangle if time be
* Motor
* Pen, would be awesome

* Android support, cymunk error removal

Android support problems:

* Rect not working
* major inconsistencies with pymunk api causes problems
*
