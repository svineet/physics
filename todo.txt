Bug:

* Joints dont get drawn in paused mode
* Toolbar is ugly
* toolbar pause button doesn't show state
* Toolbar scrolling, too many tools to fit in one place.
* Implement active state of buttons
* Ground is not visible. There are segments all around. There should only be one ground body, no other static bodies.

Enhancement:

* Pen
* Invert Gravity (0, -700) to (0, 700) makes it awesomer!
* make a tool boolean property called toggle_button, then each toggle_button tool has a toggled cb which is called on toggle. Will make life easier

Critical tools to be implemented:

* Grabber
* Polygon, would make drawing easier.
* Triangle if time be
* Motor
* Pen, would be awesome
