Physics
=======

A Physics emulator made with Python, Kivy, and pymunk.


Setup
-----

You need pip to install the requirements, you should have it already if you're experienced with Python.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And `python main.py`  


Get Started
-----------
   
Select a tool and start doodling!

Features which are somewhat hard to see:
* If you've drawn a shape before, then its saved. Like if you draw a circle and then click anywhere, the same one you drew before will again be drawn. This makes it easy to duplicate stuff.
* The eraser tool is like a pen. Drag with it and everything in the path is destroyed! So fun!

All else can be discovered easily I think.


Introduction
------------

Physics is a playground for young learners to see how things work, and try out things that are hard to do in real world. Like drop a ball from a tower to see which lands first ;)
Newton's cradle, Galileo's Pisa experiment, and simple experiments like these can easily be made in this program.

Go on, run it and have fun :)



What doesn't work:
------------------

* Triangles don't behave properly. I've looked into the issue, I couldn't find the problem.
